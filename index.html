  <p id ="Intro"> Hello my name is Margaret Jennings. I aspire to enter the field of tech by pursuing computer science. I have many hobbies and enjoy learning new things please check them out in the portfolio section. </p>
<br>
<p>I took a simple 1 semester course in high school that centered around web development where we learned some basic HTML & CSS. This introduction into coding sparked my interest into the field of CS!</p>
<br>
<p> I hope to make many connections along the way as I continue to explore the world of tech! </p>
