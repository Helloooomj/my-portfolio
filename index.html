  <p id ="Intro"> Hello my name is Margaret Jennings. I aspire to enter the field of tech by majoring in computer science. I have many hobbies and enjoy learning new things. </p>
<br>
<p>I took a simple 1 semester course in high school that centered around web development where we learned some basic HTML & CSS. This introduction into coding sparked my interest into the field of CS!</p>
<br>
<p> I hope that by majoring in CS I make lots of great connections and memories along the way.</p>
